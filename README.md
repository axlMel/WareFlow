# WareFlow 🏗️📦

This repository represents a real learning and development process, not a polished template project.

**WareFlow** is a full stack web application designed to manage inventory and product assignments in real-world operational environments.

This project is part of my transition into full stack software development and represents my first complete Ruby on Rails application deployed to production.
